## What is it?

Think of Jim as its own language that is a superset of [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/). Jim adds more JavaScript interop capbitilies on top of Elm. Right now the project is in its infancy, but hopeuflly some day it will have it's own compiler and package manager, and it may even differ from Elm in other ways.

## Installation

**Elm:** [elm-git-install](https://github.com/Skinney/elm-git-install)

**[JavaScript](https://github.com/ursi/jim-js):** `npm install @ursi/jim-js`
